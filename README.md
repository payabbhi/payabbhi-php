                                      'amount' => $amount,
                                      'currency' => $currency));

// Retrieve a particular order object
$order = $client->order->retrieve($orderId);

// Retrieve a set of order objects based on given filter params
$orders = $client->order->all(array('count' => 2));

// Retrieve a set of payments for a given order
$payments = $client->order->retrieve($orderId)->payments();
```

### Payments

// Retrieve all payments
$payments = $client->payment->all();

// Retrieve a set of refund objects for a given payment with optional filter params
$refunds = $payment->refunds();
```
